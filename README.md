# Deep-learning-based I/O pattern generation

This is for a demonstration of how to use generative models to produce I/O patterns. 

We analize real-world, large-scale I/O traces and build two deep learning models (Feature Generator and Trace Generator). We share our models and parameters to demonstrate generating I/O patterns.

Please check out `featureSelection.ipynb` and `traceGeneration.ipynb` for the demonstration.
